## Assignment-1

### Concepts Covered:

This assignment encompasses a wide array of fundamental concepts in algorithmic problem-solving. It delves into the following key areas:

1. **Algorithmic Analysis:**
   - This section involves the study of algorithm efficiency through rigorous analysis. Students learned how to compare algorithms in terms of their worst-case performance using Big O notation. This knowledge enables them to select and implement appropriate algorithms for various problem scenarios.

2. **Stable Matching:**
   - The assignment explores the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm, a fundamental concept in combinatorial optimization. By understanding the mechanics of stable matching, students gained insights into scenarios involving optimal pairings, such as job placements, college admissions, and collaborative projects.

3. **Optimization Strategies:**
   - This section is focused on devising strategies to optimize resource allocation and collaboration in scenarios with multiple stakeholders. Students learned how to balance the preferences and constraints of different entities to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.

4. **Data Representation and Simulation:**
   - Through practical exercises, students learned how to represent complex scenarios using data structures. By simulating interactions between entities, they gained hands-on experience in modeling real-world situations. This included creating classes to represent entities, implementing matching algorithms, and evaluating outcomes.

### Assignment Goal:

The primary objective of this assignment was to provide with a comprehensive understanding of algorithmic principles and their practical applications. By tackling a diverse set of problems, problem-solving skills were enhanced, a systematic approach to algorithm design was developed, and learned how to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world challenges.
Additionally, the assignment aimed to foster critical thinking and logical reasoning, preparing to tackle complex computational problems.
